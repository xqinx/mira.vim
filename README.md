# mira.vim
This is a vim/nvim color scheme specifically designed for E-Ink monitors.

The monitor I used for developing is Mira Pro from Boox, hence
the scheme's name.

It's still a WIP effort but at a point it's usable for my basic coding needs.

## Done Features
* Customized pallete to display grey scale (binary, actually) colors
* Bold, italic, underline defined for syntax groups
* Diff view
* Powerline status and tab status support
* NERDTree support

## TODOs
* more syntax tweaks for common languages: markdown, python, js

This work is inspired by the popular color scheme
[gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox), which is my togo scheme when I am
on a regular display
